# Campingscraper

## Description
Webscraper to look for campsite availability on California State Parks 6 months out (you could theoretically set the date to whenever)

## Getting started:
* This is written in Python3, not 2
* You'll need to install a couple of packages, most notably selenium and geckodriver (to run Firefox automatically)
* You'll also need to read the comments and replace a few things with whatever fits your campsite (So specific text searches, etc).
* You'll need to set up a dev email account to email yourself with.  There's a link in the comments to instructions on how to do this with gmail.
